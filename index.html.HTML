                I am a passionate, self-motivated and devoted engineer acquainted with engineering skills in the field
                of Automation and Control Systems and a demonstrated ability to multitask under little or no
                supervision, providing high quality services, in automation related systems, such as PLCs,
                SCADA, HMI, VFD, Instrumentation, Industrial Process Controls and Plant Electrical

                 What do i expect from ROBOTICs Dojo training program? Well, i expect to learn how to develop Robotics systems, from designing
                 to building and how to code them as well as grasp a solid foundation of maths and science behind robots. Besides, i would also like to develop collaborative and leadership skills from this program. These and many other skills will help me build new Robots
                 to solve real life problems in Africa and for all my future clients at a large.
